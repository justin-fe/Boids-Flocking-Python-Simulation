# Boids Flocking Simulation

**Description**  
This Python simulation models flocking behavior with predator-prey dynamics using object-oriented programming. Each agent follows simple rules for **cohesion**, **alignment**, and **separation**, resulting in realistic group movement. The project demonstrates computational modeling, algorithms, and interactive visualization.

**Technologies Used**  
- Python
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)  
- Matplotlib (for visualization)

**Features**  
- Simulates multiple agents (“boids”) interacting in real-time.  
- Includes predator-prey dynamics for complex behavior.  
- Visual and interactive output to explore group movement and interactions.
